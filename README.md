## Description:
A webservice that fulfils the documented API. The API is described below. A formal definition is provided in the [api.yml](./api.yml) file, but the information in this README is sufficient for describing the problem statement.

Data does not need to persist when application stops. It is sufficient to store information in memory. Database installation should not be needed for testing the solution.

### Language Selection

Company preferred language: Go

Instructions include how to get an environment in any OS that can run your project. For example, if you write your project in Javascript simply stating to "run `npm start` to start the application" was not sufficient, because the engineer may not have NPM. As a result, Provided a docker file and the required docker commands as a simple way to satisfy this requirement.

### Submitting Solution

Provided a link to a public repository, such as GitHub or BitBucket, that contains code to the provided link through Greenhouse.

### Summary-of-API-Specification

#### Endpoint: Process Rcpts

* Path: `/receipts/process`
* Method: `POST`
* Payload: Rcpt JSON
* Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

Description:

Takes in a JSON receipt (see example in the example directory) and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into `/receipts/{id}/points` to get the number of points the receipt
was awarded.

How many points should be earned are defined by the rules below.

Reminder: Data does not need to survive an application restart. This is to allow you to use in-memory solutions to track any data generated by this endpoint.

Example Response:
```json
{ "id": "7fb1377b-b223-49d9-a31a-5a02701dd310" }
```

### Endpoint: Get Points

* Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
* Method: `GET`
* Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:
```json
{ "points": 32 }
```

---

## Rules

These rules collectively define how many points are awarded to a receipt.

* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.

<!-- # FAQ

### How will this exercise be evaluated?
An engineer will review the code you submit. At a minimum they must be able to run the service and the service must provide the expected results. You should provide any necessary documentation within the repository. While your solution does not need to be fully production ready, you are being evaluated so put your best foot forward.

### I have questions about the problem statement
For any requirements not specified via an example, use your best judgment to determine the expected result.

### Can I provide a private repository?
If at all possible, we prefer a public repository because we do not know which engineer will be evaluating your submission. Providing a public repository
ensures a speedy review of your submission. If you are still uncomfortable providing a public repository, you can work with your recruiter to provide access to
the reviewing engineer.

### How long do I have to complete the exercise?
There is no time limit for the exercise. Out of respect for your time, we designed this exercise with the intent that it should take you a few hours. But, please
take as much time as you need to complete the work. -->

## Running-the-Server

### Environment Setup

#### Requirements:
- Docker
- PostgreSQL

#### .env File Setup:
You must have a `.env` file in the `dockerFiles` and root directory containing the following:

```env
DB_HOST=db
DB_USER=<your_db_user>
DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
DB_NAME=<your_db_name>
PORT=8080

TEST_DB_HOST=localhost
TEST_DB_USER=postgres
TEST_DB_PASSWORD=<your_test_db_password>
TEST_DB_NAME=<your_test_db_name>
TEST_DB_PORT=5435
```

### Reset Directives

To reset Docker, including volumes and images, use the following commands:

```sh
docker system df
docker-compose -f dockerFiles/docker-compose.yml down --rmi all -v --remove-orphans
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
docker system df
```

### Building and Running the Docker Containers

To build and run the Docker containers, execute:

```sh
docker-compose -f dockerFiles/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

This will start the application on the specified port (default is 8080).

### Testing-the-API

#### Optional (if you have jq [library]):
add " | jq" at end of each curl statement below to get cleaner json format...

#### Create a new receipt (`POST`):
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/receipts/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "retailer": "Target",
    "purchaseDate": "2022-01-01",

```

#### Creating a new receipt (`POST`) from stored `JSON` file:
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/receipts/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @[Directory of JSON Files]/[JSON File]
```
##### Example:
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/receipts/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @examples/readme-mmCornerMarket-receipt.json
```

#### Retrieve (`GET`) the list of all receipts:
```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/receipts/
```

#### Retrieve (`GET`) a specific receipt by ID (replace `RECEIPT_ID` with the actual ID returned in the response):
```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/receipts/RECEIPT_ID
```

#### Retrieve (`GET`) the points for a specific receipt by ID (replace `RECEIPT_ID` with the actual ID returned in the response):
```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/receipts/RECEIPT_ID/points
```

#### Running a command to a non-existent endpoint should return an Endpoint not found.
```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/rcpt
```

Hereâ€™s the updated section for running unit tests, including the instruction to change into the `model` directory first:

---

## Running-Unit-Tests
#### Requirements:
- PostgreSQL
- Postgres App (Optional but Ideal)

### Running Tests Locally in model

To run unit tests, follow these steps:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is Running:
  Before running the tests, make sure that PostgreSQL is running and configured with the correct host, user, password, database name, and port as specified in your .env file.
  - Ideally do this in the Postgres app.
  - You are free to create a Server in your Postgres app with matching host, user, password, database name, and port as is in receipt_test.go or change the "DBConfig" to your needs.


2. **Navigate to the `model` Directory**:
   Change into the `model` directory where the test files are located:

   ```sh
   cd model
   ```

3. **Reset the Test Database**:
   Ensure the test database is reset to avoid conflicts with existing data.

4. **Run the Tests**:
   Use the following command to run the tests:

   ```sh
   go test -v ./...
   ```

5. **Check Coverage**:
   To check the test coverage, run:

   ```sh
   go test -coverprofile=coverage.out
   go tool cover -html=coverage.out
   ```
